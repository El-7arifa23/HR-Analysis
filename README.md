# Project Overview

HR Attrition Analysis is a cross-functional data analytics project aimed at understanding why employees leave a company. Using a simulated dataset from a fictional tech firm, the project walks through every step of the data analysis pipelineâ€”from data cleaning and modeling to visualization and business insights.

# ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

Tool |	Purpose
SQL	| Database modeling & querying
Python	| EDA, feature analysis, and plots
Excel	| Cleaning, filtering, and pivoting
Power BI	| Dashboard creation and storytelling
Tableau	| Visualization and insight communication

# ðŸ§ª Methodology

## Data Cleaning

  Checked for missing/nulls, incorrect data types, duplicates

## Data Modeling

  Built a star schema with:

  1 Fact Table: Fact_Performance
  7 Dimensions: Dim_Employee, Dim_Department, Dim_JobRole, etc.
  4 Custom Dimensions (e.g., Dim_Rating, Dim_Training)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

  Python & Excel used to find patterns and develop hypotheses
## Dashboards

  Power BI & Tableau dashboards designed for clarity, insight, and action


# ðŸ“‚ How to Use

### 1- Clone the Repo:
### 2- Open Excel files for raw data views and pivot tables
### 3- Run Python notebooks (install pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
### 4- Open .pbix (Power BI) or .twbx (Tableau) for full dashboards

## Important Note:
Some file paths may break depending on your folder structure. Make sure to adjust relative paths where needed.
