📊 Project Overview
HR Attrition Analysis is a cross-functional data analytics project aimed at understanding why employees leave companies.
Using a simulated dataset from a fictional tech firm, the project walks through the full data analysis pipeline — from cleaning and modeling to visualization and business recommendations.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
SQL	Database modeling, querying
Python	EDA, feature analysis, visualization
Excel	Data cleaning, filtering, pivoting
Power BI	Dashboard creation, storytelling
Tableau	Insight communication, advanced visuals

🧪 Methodology
✅ Data Cleaning
Checked for missing values, incorrect types, duplicates.

✅ Data Modeling
Built a star schema:

1 Fact Table → Fact_Performance

7 Dimensions → Dim_Employee, Dim_Department, Dim_JobRole, etc.

4 Custom Dimensions → Dim_Rating, Dim_Training, etc.

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Used Python & Excel to explore trends, develop hypotheses.

✅ Dashboards
Created clear, actionable visualizations using Power BI & Tableau.

📂 How to Use
1️⃣ Clone the repository.
2️⃣ Open Excel files for raw data views and pivot tables.
3️⃣ Run Python notebooks (requires pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
4️⃣ Open .pbix (Power BI) or .twbx (Tableau) files to explore dashboards.

⚠ Note:
Some file paths may vary depending on your local folder setup. Adjust relative paths as needed.
