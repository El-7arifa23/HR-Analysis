📊 Project Overview
The HR Attrition Analysis project is a cross-functional data analytics initiative designed to uncover why employees leave companies.
Using simulated data from a fictional tech firm, we walk through the entire data pipeline:
✅ Data Cleaning → ✅ Data Modeling → ✅ Visualization → ✅ Business Recommendations.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
🛠 Tool	🔍 Purpose
SQL	Database modeling, querying
Python	EDA, feature analysis, visualizations
Excel	Data cleaning, filtering, pivoting
Power BI	Dashboard creation, storytelling
Tableau	Insight communication, advanced visuals

🧪 Methodology
🔹 Data Cleaning → Checked for missing values, incorrect types, duplicates

🔹 Data Modeling → Built a star schema:

1️⃣ Fact Table → Fact_Performance

7️⃣ Dimensions → Dim_Employee, Dim_Department, Dim_JobRole, etc.

4️⃣ Custom Dimensions → Dim_Rating, Dim_Training, etc.

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Used Python & Excel to uncover trends, develop hypotheses

🔹 Dashboards → Created actionable visualizations with Power BI & Tableau
